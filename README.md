# Rugby Counter App

## Description
This is the second project of the second phase of Google Developer Challenge Scholarship - Android Basics - 2017/2018, on order to obtain a nanodegree. The subject was to create a score keeper app, tracking points of two different players or teams.

I chose to build a rugby counter app, tracking the points obtained by French team and New Zealand team, adding 5 points for a try, 2 points for a conversion and 3 points for a penalty / drop. The reset button, when pressed,  sets both scores at zero at the end of the match.

## Technical points
<ul>
  <li>Use of ScrollView</li>
  <li>Implement score buttons and reset button</li> 
  <li>Complex layout implemented both on landscape and portrait views with LinearLayout and RelativeLayout </li>
  <li>Image positioning</li>
  <li>Use dimens, strings, colors and style xml files</li>
</ul>
